# Project Management Plan:

## Introduction:

This project is all about the banking application. This app will contain two modules app admin module and app user module. In the app user module the user will do the transactions and requests for their necessary requirements and they can also check there account details and needs. In the app admin module, admin will do the necessary actions and requests of all the users and they will post all the needs of the users. The application development process will be done by the web developer and interface with the UI developer and backend work will be done by the back-end developer. The team lead will handle the work process.

# Project Quality Management Plan:

Quality Management Plan is about maintaining the quality throughout the project that is at deliverables and processes along with allocating the responsibility to different people in the project to meet the requirements of the clients. 

Metrics:

We use the following metrics to measure the quality:
•	High level malfunctions are caused by planning errors. This should be taken care of by project manager. 
•	Intermediate stage faults are close to bugs. These are the mistakes that arise when we integrate various pieces into one project. Then we can do ample research. 
•	Low Level Defects are software-related hardware defects and can be removed by providing the software required. 
•	Unit Percentage of test cases = (Number of tests passed / Cumulative tests performed)*100
•	Compatibility The proportion of test cases = (Number of exams obtained / Maximum experiments carried out)*100 
•	Number of bugs per test = Total number of faults/ Total number of tests 
•	Set defect percentage = (Current defects / Total recorded defects) * 100 
•	Test Quality Output = Amount of Tests / Overall time 
•	Error Locate Average = Total number of faults / Total test hours.
•	Availability criteria = (Number of specifications protected / Maximum requirements)*100 
•	Percentage of test cases conducted = (Number of test runs / Total number of test runs required)*100
•	Acceptance defects = 0 High defects, 2 Medium defects, 4 Low defects = defects accepted by team / Total defects reported as valid

# Project Resource Management:

Project Resource Management is about managing the resources of an organiization such as human skills, financial resources, inventory etc., effectively.

# Project Risk Management

Risk management is the way toward distinguishing zones of risk that could adversely affect the accomplishment of the task and proactively dealing with those regions. The methodology we have taken to oversee dangers for this venture incorporates a procedure by which the task dangers are distinguished and positioned by the different impact of that chance on the undertaking.

This project is an easy to understand and simple to explore site with a quality substance pretty much all the procedure gatherings and the information regions. We give an interface where the client can choose an occasion to be visited or sorted out and make the booking as per their necessities.

## Risk mitigation strategies:

SNo|Major Risks|Strategies to Mitigate Risks|
----|----|------|
1 |Missing clarity on requirements and incorrect functionality implementation|Proper clarity on requirements are documented and given to all the employees who are working on project
2 |Team gelling|In the beginning of the project itself, the correct team will be chosen.
3 |Communication between project team and stakeholders|Proper communication plans need to be established. A sufficient number of meetings should be held between them and the documents for future reference should be given for each meeting.
4 |Proper functioning of the project |Each module must be checked for its correctness. In any case, monitoring must not be ignored.
5 | Budget deficiency for the project|The budget must be tracked and controlled at every level of the project and submitted to the stakeholders.

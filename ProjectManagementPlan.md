# Project Management Plan:

## Introduction:

This project is all about the banking application. This app will contain two modules app admin module and app user module. In the app user module the user will do the transactions and requests for their necessary requirements and they can also check there account details and needs. In the app admin module, admin will do the necessary actions and requests of all the users and they will post all the needs of the users. The application development process will be done by the web developer and interface with the UI developer and backend work will be done by the back-end developer. The team lead will handle the work process.

# Project Quality Management Plan:

Quality Management Plan is about maintaining the quality throughout the project that is at deliverables and processes along with allocating the responsibility to different people in the project to meet the requirements of the clients. 

Metrics:

We use the following metrics to measure the quality:  
•	High level malfunctions are caused by planning errors. This should be taken care of by project manager.  
•	Intermediate stage faults are close to bugs. These are the mistakes that arise when we integrate various pieces into one project. Then we can do ample research.   
•	Low Level Defects are software-related hardware defects and can be removed by providing the software required.   
•	Unit Percentage of test cases = (Number of tests passed / Cumulative tests performed)*100  
•	Compatibility The proportion of test cases = (Number of exams obtained / Maximum experiments carried out)*100   
•	Number of bugs per test = Total number of faults/ Total number of tests   
•	Set defect percentage = (Current defects / Total recorded defects) * 100   
•	Test Quality Output = Amount of Tests / Overall time   
•	Error Locate Average = Total number of faults / Total test hours.  
•	Availability criteria = (Number of specifications protected / Maximum requirements)*100 
•	Percentage of test cases conducted = (Number of test runs / Total number of test runs required)*100
•	Acceptance defects = 0 High defects, 2 Medium defects, 4 Low defects = defects accepted by team / Total defects reported as valid

# Project Resource Management:

# Project Risk Management

Risk management is the way toward distinguishing zones of risk that could adversely affect the accomplishment of the task and proactively dealing with those regions. The methodology we have taken to oversee dangers for this venture incorporates a procedure by which the task dangers are distinguished and positioned by the different impact of that chance on the undertaking.

This project is an easy to understand and simple to explore site with a quality substance pretty much all the procedure gatherings and the information regions. We give an interface where the client can choose an occasion to be visited or sorted out and make the booking as per their necessities.

## Risk mitigation strategies:

SNo|Major Risks|Strategies to Mitigate Risks|
----|----|------|
1 |Missing clarity on requirements and incorrect functionality implementation|Proper clarity on requirements are documented and given to all the employees who are working on project
2 |Team gelling|In the beginning of the project itself, the correct team will be chosen.
3 |Communication between project team and stakeholders|Proper communication plans need to be established. A sufficient number of meetings should be held between them and the documents for future reference should be given for each meeting.

# Project Procurement Management:

Procurement management plan:

Procurement contracts helps in project to save much of the money spent when purchasing goods and services from outside. Types of procurement contracts are generally 3 types of bilateral contracts: price-fixed, cost-reimbursable, or time and materials.
1.	Fixed Price Contracts (FP): Fixed price contracts involve a predetermined fixed price for the product and are used when the product is well defined. Therefore, the seller bears a higher burden of the cost risk than the buyer.
2.	Cost reimbursable (CR): contracts involve payment based on sellers’ actual costs as well as a fee or incentive for meeting or exceeding project objectives. Therefore, the buyer bears the highest cost risk.
3.	Time and Material Contracts (T&M): Time and material contracts contain characteristics of both fixed price and cost reimbursable contracts and are generally used for small project cost amounts.
A few agreements may include more than one of these payment structures in a single contract for procurement contract.
The procurement strategy method helps you to identify the best vendors and manufacturers for the materials and resources you need for the project. Using the correct form of procurement contract will have a huge effect on the performance of the project, as each type of procurement contract has its own pros and cons.

A few types of procurement documents are:
•	RFP - A request for proposal is an early stage in a procurement process issuing an invitation for suppliers, often through a bidding process, to submit a proposal on a specific commodity or service.
•	RFI - A request for information (RFI) is a proposal requested from a potential seller or a service provider to determine what products and services are potentially available in the marketplace to meet a buyer's needs and to know the capability of a seller in terms of offerings and strengths of the seller.
•	RFQ - A request for quotation (RFQ) is used when discussions with bidders are not required (mainly when the specifications of a product or service are already known) and when price is the main or only factor in selecting the successful bidder.
•	Solicitations: These are invitations of bids, requests for quotations and proposals. These may serve as a binding contract.
•	Offers - This type of procurement documents are bids, proposals and quotes made by potential suppliers to prospective clients.
•	Contracts - Contracts refer to the final signed agreements between clients and suppliers.
•	Amendments/Modifications - This refers to any changes in solicitations, offers and contracts. Amendments/Modifications have to be in the form of a written document.
